<h2><p style="text-align: center;">South Coast Marine Values Mapper</p></h2>

## Researchers: 

This project is being led by Tim Langlois and Matt Navarro from the University of Western Australia in partnership with the Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions (DBCA).

## Invitation

You have been invited to use the Marine Values Mapper as a member of the south coast community or a visitor to the south coast. 

## Aim

This Marine Values Mapper will be used to inform marine park planning on the south coast of Western Australia, helping to ensure management arrangements reflect the communityâ€™s knowledge, use and values of the area. 

## Participation

You will be asked to select areas on maps based on knowledge you have, things you do there or values you hold. The level of detail you are willing to provide will determine how long the survey takes, but on average most people take between 15 and 30 minutes.

## Voluntary participation and withdrawal from the study

Participation is voluntary and you have complete control over the information that you would like to provide. You will be able to select which activities and values you would like to provide information for. You may also withdraw from the survey at any time without consequence before you finalise the survey and your responses will be destroyed. However, as the survey is anonymous we will not be able to destroy your response after it has been submitted. 

## Your privacy

Your participation in this study and any information you provide will be treated in a confidential manner. Any data presented publicly or in workshops as part of marine park planning or in subsequent publications will be in a non-identifiable format. Your responses will be stored on password protected computers at DBCA and the University of Western Australia.

## Possible benefits

The information you provide will help ensure the south coast marine park is suitably designed to protect the values and uses that the community holds for the area. The information collected will be used in marine park planning public workshops and stakeholder engagements.

## Possible risks and how they will be managed

The responses you provide will be used by DBCA and local planners to help design the south coast marine park. Their intention is to use the information to avoid unnecessarily restricting the activities you enjoy on the south coast. However, there is also no guarantee that your activities will not be impacted even if you report them here. If you have concerns regarding how information you provided was used, feel free to contact DBCA using the details below to discuss the matter further.

## Contacts

If you have any questions about the survey please contact Dr. Matt Navarro at UWA on (08) 6488 4364. 

If you have questions about south coast marine park planning in general please contact the DBCA south coast marine management planning team at pscmp@dbca.wa.gov.au

Sincerely,
Dr. Matt Navarro
